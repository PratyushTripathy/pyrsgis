pyrsgis: A Python package to read, process and export GeoTIFFs.
===============================================================

pyrsgis enables the user to read, process and export GeoTIFFs. 
The module is built on the GDAL library, but is much more convenient 
when it comes to reading and exporting GeoTIFs. There are several 
other functions available in this package that ease raster pre-processing, 
some focused on machine learning tasks.

Feedback and bug reports are most welcome. Since this is an open-source 
project, I always look forward to contributors.
